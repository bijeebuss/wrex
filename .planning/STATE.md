## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Vite 7 required by @tanstack/react-start@1.159.5 (plan specified Vite 6)
- TanStack Start v1.159.5 uses new entry API: server.tsx exports {fetch}, router.tsx exports getRouter(), StartClient takes no props
- ScrollRestoration component deprecated; use createRouter option instead
- No createServerFileRoute API in TanStack Start v1.159.5; intercepted /api/chat in server.tsx fetch handler instead
- Chat handler in src/lib/claude/ (not routes/api/) to avoid TanStack Router file scanning warnings
- Drizzle relational queries use .sync() for synchronous better-sqlite3 execution
- Sequential embedding in embedBatch (node-llama-cpp context handles one request at a time)
- Concurrent-safe singleton init for embedder using shared promise to prevent duplicate model loading
- stderr-only logging in embedder module to preserve MCP stdio transport
